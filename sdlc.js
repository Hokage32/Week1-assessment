// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintenence 

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysis = "This is the second step, in this step the developer needs to research what is asked of him and determine what needs to be done to complete the task."

const design = "Step 3, the developer knows what he needs to do and now needs to come up with designs on how he wants to create the project."

const Implementation = "Step 4, the developer is now done with planning, analysis, and design. Now the thoughts and ideas need to be written into code to make the project come together."

const testing = "Step 5, after implementation, the developer needs to see if his ideas and code actually work. Thats where testing and debugging code come into play."

const Maintenence = "Final step, the developer knows his code works, and has uploaded the project. Now he needs to check back regularly and maintain the site."
